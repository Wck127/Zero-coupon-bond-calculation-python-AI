# Zero-Coupon Bond Yield Calculator (Python Basics + NumPy & AI)

This project demonstrates how to calculate the yield to maturity (YTM) of zero-coupon bonds using Python fundamentals:
- Variables
- Loops
- Functions
- NumPy

## Formula
YTM = (Face Value / Price)^(1 / Years to Maturity) - 1

## Example
For a $1,000 bond priced at $800 with 5 years to maturity:
YTM = (1000 / 800)^(1/5) - 1 = 4.56%

## What I Practiced
- Writing reusable functions  
- Using loops for multiple bond calculations  
- Applying NumPy for vectorized math  
- Connecting programming concepts to finance applications
